'''
This is a program to get the weather form openweathermap.org 
It allows the user to check the weather for multiple locations
It checks if the location is valid and notifies the user
It uses try blocks to detect connection errors and notifies the user 

EXTRA CREDIT
Display the Clouds or Winds forecast in terms of partly, mostly cloudy, and calm, breezy, windy.
Allow the user to obtain weather forecast data using their zip code and city

Known bug:
Some zipcodes appear to be slightly wrong in the database
